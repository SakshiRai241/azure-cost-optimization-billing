## How I Used ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner for this assignment to:

- Understand Azure-native ways to optimize serverless architecture costs
- Structure my thought process around cold vs hot storage
- Validate ideas like using Azure Functions and Blob tiers
- Explore pseudocode and edge case handling

## My Own Contributions

Although I used ChatGPT to explore the problem, I:

- Designed and structured the solution myself
- Wrote and edited the markdown content manually
- Created and committed the architecture, pseudocode, and files independently
- Thought through cost, latency, and API design based on my own understanding

This was a helpful collaboration tool to speed up ideation, but all implementation was done by me personally.
